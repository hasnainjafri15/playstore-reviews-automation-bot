0,Amazing and so much friendly app to purchase groceries whenever you want.,"There is a huge bug in this app, which needs immediate attention. Using the app, one cannot enter a delivery address of most of the sectors of DHA-2 Islamabad. In reality, however, these guys do deliver in all sectors of DHA-2.",Very bad experience order didn't get confirmed and it remained pending for the whole time,"App works fine. No issues registering a new account and placing or editing an order.

Full Review","After reading the reviews, I was the least motivated to download the app but I decided to give it a go. It turned out really good, the order was at my place in 20 minutes. Fresh and warm. I hope Burger Lab stays consistent and continues the great service.","needs improvement, at the bigining while signing up selection of area required and drop down list does not cover all the areas (Karachi's) and doesn't allow to add the desired area. Similarly there is no option available while updating the user profile.","Absolutely terrible. Ordered from a restaurant 35 minutes ago and my order is still pending. The restaurant told me that they're not even affiliated with this app. Also, their support system doesn't work either.",App doesn't log in with Facebook account. Keeps saying 'Try again'. Not working good after the latest update.,N/A,ASKING ME TO ADD AN OPTIONAL ITEM AS A REQUIRED ITEM IN THE SELECTION MENU TO ADD TO CART. SERIOUSLY? APP HAS HIGHER PRICES THAN ZOMATO AND NO OFFERS. STAY AWAY.
